Personal DSA study notes

# Algorithm Design
- There will usually be 2 parts in an algorithm
1. remember past states/computations.
2. use that "memory" to perform computation until desired result is obtained.

# Interview Guidelines
1. READ! the problem carefully, DON'T rush to code.
2. Identify ambiguity/questions, try figure them out.
3. Know EXACTLY what inputs are and what desired outputs look like.
4. Play with examples by drawing (visualizing) them first.
    + Look for patterns
    + Think what data structures are involved (or needs to be involved)
5. Code.

## Practice/Training Tips
- Limit (pure and rigorous) thinking time to 5 ~ 15 minutes max. Try answering
> “What is the simplest thing I can track to solve this?”
  - If you're still debating after that time , choose the **simplest** state variable
### Guideline
**Thinking mode (≤10 min):**    
- identify events
- identify state
- identify update rule

**Execution mode (immediately after):** 
- write a rough version
- clean it up later 
Messy but correct code early beats elegant code late.
