Personal DSA study notes

# Notes
1. [how to cultivate algorithmic maturity by solving problems?](concepts.md)
2. [Sliding Window Tips](sliding_window/concept.md)
3. [Last Seen Index](Last-Seen-Index/concept.md)
4. [DFS Guide](DFS/concept.md)
5. [BFS Guide](BFS/concept.md)
6. [DP Approaches](1-D\ DP/concept.md)

# Interview Guidelines
1. READ! the problem carefully, DON'T rush to code.
2. Identify ambiguity/questions, try figure them out.
3. Know EXACTLY what inputs are and what desired outputs look like.
4. Play with examples by drawing (visualizing) them first.
  + Look for patterns
  + Think what data structures are involved (or needs to be involved)
5. Code.

## Side Notes
- Limit (pure and rigorous) thinking time to 5 ~ 15 minutes max. Try answering
> “What is the simplest thing I can track to solve this?”
  - If after that time you're still debating, choose the **simplest** state variable
### Guideline
**Thinking mode (≤10 min):**    
- identify events
- identify state
- identify update rule

**Execution mode (immediately after):** 
- write a rough version
- clean it up later 
Messy but correct code early beats elegant code late.
